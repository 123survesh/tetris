# tetris

Hi, I am learning game dev and this ("tetris") is the first game that I made from scratch with javascript. I have used HTML canvas to draw all the moving elements that can be seen in this game. 

Play the game : https://123survesh.github.io/tetris/

Thanks for stopping by, the game still needs some major make up to make it look and feel beautifull, I will be getting to it in due time :)
